Pyinstaller is kinda nasty with pyqt, so some options are needed:
First comes the command for debugging:

pyinstaller.exe -d -c --hidden-import PyQt5.sip --clean -y --add-data "QT;QT" main.py
then run with cmd /K main.exe for debugging output

Explanation:
-d: means develop and outputs everything
-c: opens the console to read the output
--hidden-import PyQt.sip: includes PyQt stuff that is not detected automatically
--clean: deletes all old build data
-y: confirms everything mainly overwriting old stuff in debug dir
--add-data "QT;QT": is needed to provide all *.ui files and all other data to the executable
main.py: is the application entry point to compile

and now the command for deployment build:
pyinstaller.exe --onefile --windowed --hidden-import PyQt5.sip --clean -y --add-data "QT;QT" main.py

Explanation:
--onefile: compiles to single *.exe files
--windowed: surpresses console
